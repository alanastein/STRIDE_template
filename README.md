## STRIDE_project_template
Setting up a template repository to manage STRIDE projects

The purpose of this project is to examine the spatial prevalence of food banks in the Western US.
My hypothesis is that food banks are inequitably distributed. I hypothesize that distribution varies by the regions racial composition, poverty levels, and rurality..

I plan to collect data from IPUMS, 990 forms and a database that I will build by looking at Feeding America, government websites, the IRS, and Google for food banks.

I plan to use [] as my test set.

Any file or script added to this repository will be added or linked out to storage location from one of the following components:
* Data management plan file (explains how data are to be organized, stored and shared)
* get_raw_data folder (scripts to get the data and a link to the storage of the directly downloaded data with no cleaning)
* analyze_data folder (scripts for any transformation of the raw data and links to the resulting processed dataset )
